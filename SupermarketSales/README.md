# Supermarket Sales Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the historical sales data of a supermarket to uncover insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and product popularity. The analysis was conducted using SQL for data manipulation and Tableau for visualization.

## Objectives
- **Identify trends in sales** across different branches of the supermarket.
- **Analyze customer purchasing patterns**.
- **Determine the most popular and profitable product lines**.
- **Investigate the impact of time** (hour of the day / month) on sales.

It includes details such as invoice ID, branch information, customer type, gender, product line, unit price, quantity, tax, total amount, date, time, payment method, COGS, gross margin percentage, gross income, and customer ratings.
